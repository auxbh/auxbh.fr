    ðŸ‘‹ â€¢ Hey, I'm Arthur!

<p>
    I'm a self-taught developer from France who enjoys Roblox, Fortnite and rhythm games.<br>
    I have experience in <a style="color: #01a3ff" href="https://luau-lang.org/" target="_blank">Luau</a>, and I know a few other programming languages.<br><br>
    I'm currently using Hugo for my website as you can see on my blog post, but I'll probably move on to something else once I find the right tool, as I don't really plan on using the blog aspect.
