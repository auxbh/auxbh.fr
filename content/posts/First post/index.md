I was tired of my old website with broken CSS and I wasn't working on it. But I discovered this fabulous tool called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is an amazing program that transforms regular markdown files into websites using templates! I went with the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) one as it is pretty and well documented.
